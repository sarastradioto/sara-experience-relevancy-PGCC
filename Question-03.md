# Question 03 - PGCC Application

## Describe in detail the extent and relevance of your teaching experience to anticipated teaching assignments.

For almost 5 years I worked as a Spanish teacher for undergraduate students at the Academic Center of Social Sciences, a language center at the Federal University of Minas Gerais in Brazil. I taught all levels, from basic to advanced, plus a course about speaking and writing in Spanish. I had a range of 5 groups per semester, and each group had between 15 and 25 students. I was responsible for developing each group’s course program, planning lessons, elaborating oral and writing tests, choosing a literature book to be assigned in class, creating evaluated written compositions, submitting students’ grades and absences at the management system, answering emails from students and coordination, joining teachers’ meetings, organizing two events per semester, the “Cultural Fair” and the “Noche Española” (“Spanish Night”, an event that happened one evening/semester at a local Spanish restaurant where students were invited to play games, to sing karaoke, and to eat, all in Spanish), recruiting new professionals, and attending workshops promoted by the Academic Center for professional training and updates. 
The other teaching experiences I had involved many or some of the above-mentioned assignments. Also, as a Spanish teacher for Spanish teachers of Brazilian public schools, I was responsible for developing the textbook to be used in the course.
