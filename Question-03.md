# Question 03 - PGCC Application

## Describe in detail the extent and relevance of your teaching experience to anticipated teaching assignments.

As in every teaching practice, when asked to elaborate a course program, I build it according to the students’ needs. Many times, previous syllabi and course maps can be readapted to different groups of students with only minor adjustments. Still, sometimes special circumstances mean adaptating previously designed courses actually a hinder to the learning process. Both methods, adapting from a template or designing from scratch, are necessary tools for meeting the challenges of modern higher-level education. Here below I will expand on what I feel these challenges mean for anticipated teaching assignments, as well as show situations where designing a whole new course from scratch was the best course of action. 

As a teacher, I have noticed that the organization of the contents in SSL (Spanish as a Second Language) textbooks is mostly determined by lexical fields. For example, there is usually a chapter for the names of the “rooms of the house”. For students who live in an urban environment, this content does not clash with their archetype of a house. However, there are students who sleep, eat, and rest in huts with no inside division. This is the reality of a group of indigenous who were once interested in learning Spanish and had myself as their teacher. This challenging experience encouraged me to develop a course program of Spanish that combined social and anthropological issues. First, I worked on awaking an awareness of the students’ way of life. It was only after this social consciousness that the "Hispanic world" was first introduced to the classroom. 

Another experience I consider worth mentioning is teaching Spanish for Spanish teachers of High Schools. My students were experienced professionals interested in updating their theoretical and methodological knowledge. When I started to develop the program course, I noticed a completely absence of textbooks for this specific public. So, I decided to create my own SSL Textbook that matched advanced Spanish with pedagogical issues. This unique combination supplied the needs of this specific group of students.  

The two above testimonies give an overview of the extent and relevance of my teaching experience.
